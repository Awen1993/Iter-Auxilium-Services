         <h2>Secure & Comfortable Housing Options – A Safe and Convenient Stay for Teacher Trainees 🏡</h2>
         <p>Relocating for a teaching practicum involves more than just securing a school placement—it also requires safe, comfortable, and convenient housing 
            that allows trainees to focus on their work without worrying about living arrangements. Our housing services ensure that every trainee has access 
            to well-vetted, fully furnished, and secure accommodations that fit their budget and lifestyle preferences.
         </p>
         <p>We offer a variety of housing options, including student hostels, shared apartments, homestays, and private housing, each designed to provide a stress-free, 
            home-like environment. Trainees can choose short-term or long-term stays, with flexible lease agreements that suit their practicum duration.</p>
